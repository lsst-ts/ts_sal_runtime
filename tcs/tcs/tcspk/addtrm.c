**     maxtrm  int             maximum number of terms in model
**     ntroom  int             maximum number of terms in repertoire
**     cname   char[9]         name of term

**     nterms  int*            # terms available currently (loc+std+gen)
**     coeffn  char[ntroom][9] names of coefficients
**
**  Returned (arguments):
**     nterms  int*            updated
**     coeffn  char[ntroom][9] updated
**     coform  char[ntroom][9] format of generic terms added to coeffn
**     model   double[maxtrm]  term numbers for model (0 = end)
**     coeffv  double[maxtrm]  coefficient values
**
**  Returned (function value):
**             int      -2 = no room left in model
**                      -1 = unrecognized term
**                       0 = no room in repertoire for new generic term
