**
**  Returned (argument):
**     vc       double[]    updated
**     pmodel   double[]    updated
**
**  Returned (function value):
**              int        status: 0 = OK (Note 7)
**
**  Called:  tptPterml, tptPterms, tptPtermg
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) It is up to the caller to make sure that nterm is within the
**     range 1 thru nterms.  If it is not, the Cartesian Az/El
**     supplied is not changed.
**
**  2) The functions of latitude, sinphi and cosphi, are used as supplied,
**     without checks for range and consistency.
**
**  3) The "mount" argument specifies the type of mount:
**
**     * If mount=1, the mount is an equatorial and the basic model is
**       -IH, ID, FLOP, -CH, -NP, -MA, ME.
**
**     * If mount=2, the mount is an altazimuth and the basic model is
**       IA, IE, FLOP, CA, NPAE, AW, AN.
**
**     * If mount=3, the mount is a generalized gimbal and the basic
**       model is IA, IE, FLOP, CA, NPAE, AW, AN.  In this case, all
**       the terms except FLOP are in the mount's nominal frame, as given
**       by the matrix ae2nm.
**
**  4) The "vc" [-h,d] vector is the direction to which the correction
**     is being applied.
**
**  5) The array "pmodel" is a list of seven coefficients which
**     comprise a basic pointing model:
**                                               term names
**        element    meaning               equatorial     other
**
**         [0,1]   index errors              -IH,ID       IA,IE
**          [2]    vertical error             FLOP        FLOP
**          [3]    collimation error          -CH          CA
**          [4]    nonperpendicularity        -NP         NPAE
**         [5,6]   misalignment              -MA,ME       AW,AN
**
**     This 7-term basic model combines the contributions from all the
**     terms in the actual, operational, model.  The recipient, for
**     example a telescope control system, need implement only this
**     7-term model (once and for all, efficiently and with proper
**     handling of awkward cases) in order to correct for all the terms
**     in whatever operational model is in use at the time.  Note also
**     that the present routine need be invoked only occasionally, to
**     to keep track of the effects of the changing telescope position.
**     Between updates, the 7-term model will be an adequate summary of
**     the operational model for the current region of sky.
**
**  6) The corrections are computed in the routines tptPterml (locally
**     implemented terms), tptPterms (standard terms) and tptPtermg
**     (generic terms).  These routines, like the present one, avoid use
**     of #includes, to facilitate their use in other contexts, for
**     example as part of a telescope control system.  The function's
**     usefulness in this regard is supplemented by the correction
**     being applied in two forms, as corrected coordinates and as
**     an updated "basic model".  The basic model is an 8-coefficient
**     generic model which summarizes, for the current telescope
**     position, the many and varied terms of the operational model.
**
**  7) The function value is the status returned by tptPterml,
**     tptPterms or tptPtermg, whichever is called.
