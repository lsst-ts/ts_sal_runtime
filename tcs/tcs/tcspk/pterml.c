**              int        status: -ve = error
**
**  Called:  tptPtpre, tptPtappl
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1) It is up to the caller to make sure that the argument "nterm" is
**     within the allowed range, i.e. 1 to the number of local terms
**     implemented.  If it is not, no adjustment is made and an error
**     status is returned.
**
**  2) The functions of latitude, sinphi and cosphi, are used as supplied,
**     without checks for range and consistency.
**
**  3) The "mount" argument specifies the type of mount:
**
**     * If mount=1, the mount is an equatorial and the basic model is
**       -IH, ID, FLOP, -CH, -NP, -MA, ME.
**
**     * If mount=2, the mount is an altazimuth and the basic model is
**       IA, IE, FLOP, CA, NPAE, AW, AN.
**
**     * If mount=3, the mount is a generalized gimbal and the basic
**       model is IA, IE, FLOP, CA, NPAE, AW, AN.  In this case, all
**       the terms except FLOP are in the mount's nominal frame, as given
**       by the matrix ae2nm.
**
**  4) The "jbp" flag specifies what state the mount is in:
**
**     * If jbp=0, the mount is in the normal state where the mechanical
**       declination or elevation is in the range +/- 90 deg.
**
**     * If jbp=1, the mount is in the other state, where the mechanical
**       declination or elevation is outside the range +/- 90 deg and the
**       mechanical hour angle or azimuth is 180 deg away from the
**       corresponding celestial value.  This state is variously called
**       "below the pole", "other side of the pier", "beyond the zenith"
**       etc.
**
**  5) The "vw" [-h,d] vector is the direction used to calculate the
**     correction.  The "vc" [-h,d] vector is the direction to which
**     the correction is being applied.
**
**  6) The array "pmodel" is a list of seven coefficients which
**     comprise a basic pointing model:
**                                               term names
**        element    meaning               equatorial     other
**
**         [0,1]   index errors              -IH,ID       IA,IE
**          [2]    vertical error             FLOP        FLOP
**          [3]    collimation error          -CH          CA
**          [4]    nonperpendicularity        -NP         NPAE
**         [5,6]   misalignment              -MA,ME       AW,AN
**
**     This 7-term basic model combines the contributions from all the
**     terms in the actual, operational, model.  The recipient, for
**     example a telescope control system, need implement only this
**     7-term model (once and for all, efficiently and with proper
**     handling of awkward cases) in order to correct for all the terms
**     in whatever operational model is in use at the time.  Note also
**     that the present routine need be invoked only occasionally, to
**     to keep track of the effects of the changing telescope position.
**     Between updates, the 7-term model will be an adequate summary of
**     the operational model for the current region of sky.
**
**  7) The purpose of the present routine is to compute the effect of
**     one local pointing term at the current position.
**
**     To simplify the coding of the different terms, the routine makes a
**     preliminary call to the tptPtpre function in order to make available
**     the telescope position in four different systems:
**
**        spherical HA/Dec
**        Cartesian -HA/Dec
**        spherical Az/El
**        Cartesian Az/El
**
**     The correction for each term is implemented by making one (or at
**     most two) calls to the tptPtappl function.
**
**  8) The following sign conventions are used:
**
**        Azimuth - zero for due south, and 90 degrees for due east.
**        (Beware!  Not the surveyor's convention, the one used by
**        TPOINT for its external interfaces!)
**
**        Elevation - the horizon is elevation zero, and the zenith
**        is elevation 90 degrees.
**
**        HA and EW corrections - positive when the corrected
**        telescope position is west of the uncorrected position.
**
**        Dec corrections - positive when the corrected telescope
**        position is north of the uncorrected position.
**
**        Azimuth and LR corrections - positive when the
**        corrected telescope position is to the left of the
**        uncorrected position as seen by someone standing at
**        the telescope looking at the sky.
**
**        Zenith distance corrections - positive when the corrected
**        telescope position is below the uncorrected position.
**
**        Elevation corrections - positive when the corrected
**        telescope position is above the uncorrected position.
**
**     The terms are reversed in sign when adjusting star positions
**     to fit telescope positions, so that the coefficients stay
**     unchanged in sign whichever of the two options (star adjusted
**     to fit telescope, or telescope adjusted to fit star) is
**     being used.
**
**  9) This routine is analogous to the tptPterms routine, but is
**     intended for the implementation of local terms.  It has an
**     identical argument list, through which everything passes, and
**     includes no non-standard header files.
