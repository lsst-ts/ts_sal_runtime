ANNOUNCE: Tile Widget Set, version 0.7.8.

~ What is it?

The Tile widget set is an experimental reimplementation
of some of the standard Tk widgets.  The main features are:

    + Native look and feel under Windows (XP, NT, and 2K)
    + Nearly-native look and feel under Mac OSX
    + "Revitalized" look and feel under X11
    + Appearance controlled by a theme engine, providing
      greater flexibility for custom widgets
    + New widgets, including notebook, progressbar, combobox,
      separator, and sizegrip.

~ What's New in 0.7.8

+ A [ttk::sizegrip] widget has been added (that's the gizmo
  sometimes seen in the lower right corner that resizes
  the window when dragged).

+ The [ttk::treeview] widget now supports item tags,
  similar to the Text and Canvas widgets.  [$tv tag bind]
  and [$tv tag configure] methods are supported.

+ The [ttk::treeview] widget now supports -selectmode {browse|extended|none}
   The default selection behavior has been improved, and
  '-selectmode none' combined with tag bindings make it
  possible to implement other behaviors if desired.

+ All widgets now have an 'identify' method, for better
  megawidget support.

+ A few more bugfixes and minor L&F improvements.

+ POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY: Widget options now take precedence
  over [style map] settings.  (This is usually the desired behavior).

~ Forward Compatibility

Due to popular demand, the [ttk::paned] widget will be
renamed to [ttk::panedwindow] in the next release.
To smooth the transition, [ttk::panedwindow] is now
available as a synonym (either one will work in 0.7.8;
in 0.8.0 the old name will become deprecated).

~ Stability

The script-level API for widgets may be considered stable at
this point, with the exception of procedures in the 'tile::*'
namespace and the [ttk::paned] widget, which will be renamed.
Theme definitions are still subject to change: user-defined
themes will need to be revised in the 0.8 series.


~ A note on version numbers

To help distinguish formal releases from CVS snapshots,
the subminor version number will be incremented immediately before
and immediately after making a release.  Thus odd-numbered subminor
versions indicate a CVS snapshot, and even-numbered ones indicate
a known release.
