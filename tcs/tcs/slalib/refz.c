**
**  Adjust an unrefracted zenith distance to include the effect of
**  atmospheric refraction, using the simple A tan z + B tan^3 z
**  model.
**
**  Given:
**    zu    double    unrefracted zenith distance of the source (radian)
**    refa  double    A: tan z coefficient (radian)
**    refb  double    B: tan^3 z coefficient (radian)
**
**  Returned:
**    *zr   double    refracted zenith distance (radian)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1  This function applies the adjustment for refraction in the
**     opposite sense to the usual one - it takes an unrefracted
**     (in vacuo) position and produces an observed (refracted)
**     position, whereas the A tan Z + B tan^3 Z model strictly
**     applies to the case where an observed position is to have the
**     refraction removed.  The unrefracted to refracted case is
**     harder, and requires an inverted form of the text-book
**     refraction models;  the formula used here is based on the
**     Newton-Raphson method.  For the utmost numerical consistency
**     with the refracted to unrefracted model, two iterations are
**     carried out, achieving agreement at the 1D-11 arcseconds level
**     for a ZD of 80 degrees.  The inherent accuracy of the model
**     is, of course, far worse than this - see the documentation for
**     slaRefco for more information.
**
**  2  At ZD 83 degrees, the rapidly-worsening A tan Z + B tan^3 Z
**     model is abandoned and an empirical formula takes over.  For
**     optical/IR wavelengths, over a wide range of observer heights and
**     corresponding temperatures and pressures, the following levels of
**     accuracy (arcsec, worst case) are achieved, relative to numerical
**     integration through a model atmosphere:
**
**              zr    error
**
**              80      0.7
**              81      1.3
**              82      2.4
**              83      4.7
**              84      6.2
**              85      6.4
**              86      8
**              87     10
**              88     15
**              89     30
**              90     60
**              91    150         } relevant only to
**              92    400         } high-elevation sites
**
**     For radio wavelengths the errors are typically 50% larger than
**     the optical figures and by ZD 85 deg are twice as bad, worsening
**     rapidly below that.  To maintain 1 arcsec accuracy down to ZD=85
**     at the Green Bank site, Condon (2004) has suggested amplifying
**     the amount of refraction predicted by slaRefz below 10.8 deg
**     elevation by the factor (1+0.00195*(10.8-E_t)), where E_t is the
**     unrefracted elevation in degrees.
**
**     The high-ZD model is scaled to match the normal model at the
**     transition point;  there is no glitch.
**
**  3  Beyond 93 deg zenith distance, the refraction is held at its
**     93 deg value.
**
**  4  See also the function slaRefv, which performs the adjustment in
**     Cartesian Az/El coordinates, and with the emphasis on speed
**     rather than numerical accuracy.
