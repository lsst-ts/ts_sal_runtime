**  Quick observed place to CIRS:  observed place at a ground based site
**  to CIRS RA,Dec, for sources distant from the solar system, given the
**  star-independent CIRS-to-observed parameters.
**
**  Given:
**     type   char[]    type of coordinates: 'R', 'H' or 'A' (see below)
**     ob1    double    observed Az, HA or RA (radians; Az is N=0,E=90)
**     ob2    double    observed ZD or Dec (radians)
**     ioprms IOpars*   star-independent CIRS-to-observed parameters:
**      along     double    longitude + s' + dERA(DUT) (radians)
**      phi       double    geodetic latitude (radians)
**      hm        double    height above sea level (meters)
**      xpl       double    polar motion xp wrt local meridian (radians)
**      ypl       double    polar motion yp wrt local meridian (radians)
**      sphi      double    sine and cosine of geodetic latitude
**      cphi      double    sine and cosine of geodetic latitude
**      diurab    double    magnitude of diurnal aberration vector
**      p         double    pressure (mb,hPa)
**      tk        double    ambient temperature (K)
**      rh        double    relative humidity (0-1)
**      tlr       double    tropospheric lapse rate (K per meter)
**      wl        double    wavelength (micrometers)
**      refa      double    refraction constant A (radians)
**      refb      double    refraction constant B (radians)
**      eral      double    "local" Earth Rotation Angle (radians)
**
**  Returned:
**     ri     double*   CIRS right ascension (CEO-based, radians)
**     di     double*   CIRS declination (radians)
**
**  Notes:
**
**  1)  Only the first character of the type argument is significant.
**      "R" or "r" indicates that ob1 and ob2 are the observed right
**      ascension and declination;  "H" or "h" indicates that they are
**      hour angle (west +ve) and declination;  anything else ("A" or
**      "a" is recommended) indicates that ob1 and ob2 are azimuth
**      (north zero, east 90 deg) and zenith distance.  (Zenith
**      distance is used rather than elevation in order to reflect the
**      fact that no allowance is made for depression of the horizon.)
**
**  2)  The accuracy of the result is limited by the corrections for
**      refraction.  Providing the meteorological parameters are
**      known accurately and there are no gross local effects, the
**      predicted CIRS RA,Dec should be within about 0.1 arcsec for a
**      zenith distance of less than 70 degrees.  Even at a topocentric
**      zenith distance of 90 degrees, the accuracy in elevation should
**      be better than 1 arcmin;  useful results are available for a
**      further 3 degrees, beyond which the slaRefro function returns a
**      fixed value of the refraction.  The complementary functions
**      slaI2o (or slaI2oqk) and slaO2i (or slaO2iqk) are self-
**      consistent to better than 1 micro-arcsecond all over the
**      celestial sphere.
**
**  3)  It is advisable to take great care with units, as even
**      unlikely values of the input parameters are accepted and
**      processed in accordance with the models used.
**
**  4)  "Observed" Az,El means the position that would be seen by a
**      perfect theodolite located at the observer.  This is
**      related to the observed HA,Dec via the standard rotation, using
**      the geodetic latitude (corrected for polar motion), while the
**      observed HA and RA are related simply through the Earth rotation
**      angle and the site longitude.  "Observed" RA,Dec or HA,Dec thus
**      means the position that would be seen by a perfect equatorial
**      located at the observer and with its polar axis aligned to the
**      Earth's axis of rotation (n.b. not to the refracted pole).  By
**      removing from the observed place the effects of atmospheric
**      refraction and diurnal aberration, the CIRS RA,Dec is obtained.
**
**  5)  Frequently, ICRS RA,Dec rather than CIRS RA,Dec will be
**      required, in which case further transformations will be
**      necessary.  The slaIbp etc. functions will convert the CIRS
**      RA,Dec produced by the present function into an ICRS astrometric
**      place, by allowing for the Sun's gravitational lens effect,
**      annual aberration and precession-nutation.
**
**  6)  To convert to CIRS RA,Dec the coordinates read from a real
**      telescope, corrections would have to be applied for encoder zero
**      points, gear and encoder errors, tube flexure, the position of
**      the rotator axis and the pointing axis relative to it, non-
**      perpendicularity between the mounting axes, and finally for the
**      tilt of the azimuth or polar axis of the mounting (with
**      appropriate corrections for mount flexures).  Some telescopes
**      would, of course, exhibit other properties which would need to
**      be accounted for at the appropriate point in the sequence.
**
**  7)  The star-independent CIRS-to-observed parameters in ioprms may
**      be computed by means of the slaI2opa function.  If nothing has
**      changed significantly except the time, the slaI2opat function
**      may be used to perform the requisite partial recomputation of
**      ioprms.
